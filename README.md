`>> Hello fri3nd.`

This is `dvrp` and `jorb`. 

This is a collection of notes, seminars and projects that we have done through our Bachelor's Degree in Engineering while we were enrolled in the Advanced Distributed Applications class of the UPF. This was not done, by any means to facilitate answers to other students, and we are not responsible for any consequence of using our code in the practices of the course, such as being accused of plagiarism or any other similar term.

# <a name="introduction"></a>Intro

The problem of extracting patterns from data is a success story. It has had results as impressive as the laws of physics or, in more recent, results in areas such as information retrieval, data mining, the character recognition or speech, predicting economic and bioinformatics among others. On all these issues, the issue is to discover regularities that automatically present the data using algorithms based on these regularities and trends, and make decisions such as classifying data into categories. Ultimately -discover- information extracted from the data. The purpose of this workshop is to present general techniques that have proved useful for extracting information. The methods introduced arise from a practical point of view, based on examples.

The course consists of three main activities: lectures, practices, and problems. In the lectures introducing the theoretical concepts and examples of its application. The problems that the students confronted with will be small problems to solve by themselves. Each problem corresponds to one of the concepts introduced in class theory. In practice, problems are more complex so that students have the opportunity to implement a series of concepts learned.

### Here are the practices done to this day:


#### Practices (Done together as a group)
